# cat-and-dog-prediction-using-keras
i have seen much cat and dog classifier so i decided to start my conv net with this only

in this project i directly download images from imagenet url list and then i resize them you have to run saving and resizing for both cat and dogs images seperately. then in the main code i created dataset folder ,in it i created another folders training_dataset and testing_dataset you can refer main training code for that. and in it there will be your image folders of cat and dog seperately keras take folder.  the directory’s name is take as the label of all the images present in it. For example : All the images inside the ‘cats’ named folder will be considered as cats by keras.and same for dogs

this is a sample code you can expand it and have fun
